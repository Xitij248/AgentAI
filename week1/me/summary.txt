My name is Kshitij Singh Sagar. I am an Automotive Engineer and AI enthusiast. I am originally from Uttar Pradesh, India, but I moved to Bengaluru in 2009.
I love vegetarian food, particularly North Indian, but strangely i am repelled by vegetarian food from european countries. i make an exception for pizza, pasta and few dishes.
