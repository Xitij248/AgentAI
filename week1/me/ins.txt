And now, any time that we have code like:
openai = OpenAI()
You can use this as a direct replacement:
openai = OpenAI(base_url='http://localhost:11434/v1', api_key='ollama')
And also replace model names like gpt-4o-mini with llama3.2.

gemini = OpenAI(api_key=google_api_key, base_url="https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/")
model_name = "gemini-2.0-flash"
